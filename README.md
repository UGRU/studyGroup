# Wait, what is UGRU?
The University of Guelph R User Group (UGRU) is an informal meetup of your friends and colleagues from around the University of Guelph who share skills, stories and ideas on using code for research, and explore open research practices. The goal is to create a friendly, no-pressure environment where people can share their work, ask for help on a coding problem, and learn and work together with their peers. **Anyone can participate -- you don't have to be an expert coder to do so!**

# Objectives
 * Learning R when you need it
 * Learning R with each other
 * Learning R from each other
 * Learning best practices in R
 * Accountability in your learning
# Implementation
 * weekly time slot
 * ask questions/challenges to other participants
 * informal presentations by participants
 * R working environment - reproducible research - code optimization
 * accountability: setting at least one personal goal per meeting
# Advantages
* For everyone
  * “Pain is ready, Pain is waiting, Primed to do its educating” (DEPECHE MODE, "Dream On")
  * the challenges will improve your R skills
  * by participating you can determine the nature of the meetings
* For grad students
  * a set time to ask questions
  * no need to waste weeks looking for an answer
  * learn from other participants’ coding/stats problems
* For faculty
  * block time each week for your own analyses
  * share your statistical knowledge/mad R skills
  * you finally have the opportunity to learn R
